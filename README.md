Housing Price Prediction â€“ Linear Regression

This project uses Linear Regression to predict housing prices from the Ames Housing Dataset, applying multiple preprocessing techniques like encoding, scaling, and cross-validation.

It was implemented as part of a lab assignment and demonstrates a real-world regression workflow using Python and Scikit-learn.

Features:

- Uses train-test split and cross-validation
- Compares multiple scalers: Standard, MinMax, MaxAbs
- Applies Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding
- Calculates and compares Mean Squared Errors (MSE)
- Visualizes prediction results using Seaborn
- Includes clean, reproducible Jupyter Notebook steps



Technologies Used:

- Python 3
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab





How to Run (If Using Jupyter Notebook):

1. Download the original `.ipynb` version from your Colab/Notebook
2. Open with Jupyter or upload to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
3. Install necessary libraries if prompted
4. Follow the step-by-step implementation


Results:

- Model trained and evaluated on multiple scaler-encoded combinations
- Observed differences in overfitting behavior with encoding methods
- Predicted vs. Actual values visualized to inspect model accuracy



Learning Highlights:

- Importance of data preprocessing
- How encoding impacts model performance
- Practical use of cross-validation
- How to evaluate regression using MSE
